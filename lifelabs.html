<h4> Hello! We are Assiduous Halogen, or group 7. And welcome to this broadcast.
    The group who studies the content of “Dietary effects of shifting schedule in the dietary patterns of high school students of APEC schools Dasmarinas.”
    We are going to talk, research, and know more about what are the impacts of not eating on time on APEC Dasmarinas students and if it has to do with one’s schedule.

<h3>The Effects of Shifting Schedules in the Dietary Patterns of High School Students of APEC Schools Dasmarinas</h3>
    <p> The idea for this study was made after one of the researchers’ learning facilitators (LF) asked a simple question: "Have you eaten your lunch?". Most of the responses made by the students stated that they did not eat lunch, and some said that they did not eat breakfast or lunch. This raises the question: Does students’ different class schedules have to do with their eating patterns? Will they have a significant effect on health? </p>
    <p>Upon further examination of the situation, it’s clear that there would be varying viewpoints on this issue; some people believe that would have a positive impact, while others disagree.  As mentioned earlier, there is a range of perspectives on this matter, it’s essential to investigate these effects because they would have implications for both students and parents.</p>
    <p>Breakfast is often referred to as "the most important meal of the day." According to the findings, skipping breakfast has an impact on both the nutritional state and academic performance of university students. Skipping breakfast is connected with decreased attention and weariness during clinical sessions, affecting both pre-clinical and clinical students. Breakfast has been considered an important dietary factor for energy regulation; for university students, breakfast consumption is associated with a range of positive outcomes. Breakfast eaters tend to be more physically active in the morning than those who don't eat until later. Because of changes in family living styles, skipping breakfast has become the standard in modern times.</p>
